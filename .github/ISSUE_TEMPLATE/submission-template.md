## üî• Your Pitch
The next generation of wireless data transmission, that is LiFi, has a wide range of applications that it can cover, using the visible light to transfer data, it can be used in big conference rooms for live audio and video transfer in the entire room to everyones personal devices at a very high speed and minimal cost, it can be used by sea divers to communicated underwater with people ouside water or even inside as radio waves cannot travel easily through water, but light can.
Lifi systems will be used in hospitals for accessing internet as it does not use harmful radio waves which can harm a patients body, it can also be used in Offices and Big organizations as a mesh network having security of data access limit within the users in a room, can be used in home automation, reducing accidents by installing lifi system on lamp posts which can actually transfer data using light to cars and tell them about accident prone areas, The Scope of Lifi is way too broad and we Team Cypher Lifi Focus on demonstratinng Indoor Navigation using Lifi for blind people, our application is going to navigate a blind person in a indoor place from one room to the other using light as a medium.
Our Project is the core of Lifi implementation which is demonstrating a part of an appliction which lifi has the capability to do.
